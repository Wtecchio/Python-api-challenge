# Python-api-challenge

This is my first project that every utilizes an API. In both jupyter notebooks I pull from https://openweathermap.org/ and Google's Maps API to organize and interpret various different types of data! Some information pulled and analyzed: Global weather data, Global Hotel data

**concepts utilized on the project:** <br />
making requests to API's to retrieve data inorder to build dataframes <br />
using and utilizing Juypter Notebook <br />
furthur understanding how to use gitbash with .gitignore <br />
data manipulation techniques to be able to represent several different statistical points in the data <br />
be able to represent data and trends through Matplotlib and being able to format the graphical data<br />
<br />
<br />

  **First opinon of settuping up the code:**
  
  APIs introduce to me a new way of obtaining datasets in a way I never expected possible. Adding this tool into my coding arsenal will pay dividens in the future being able to parse through even bigger data sets. This project also allowed me to furthur improve my proficiency in working with python/jupyter notebook and all the new libraries introduced to me. I feel very comfortable with all the skills required to complete this project.

   **Observations and Insights**

The most meaningful and statistically significant conclusion was seen with Max temp of cities relative to their latitude to the Earth. Cities located closer to the Equator(0) have, on average, higher temperatures than both ends of the graph.

The rest of the data however, does not yield much else in terms of correlative data that can be determined from a cities latitude. As seen on this result, the clump of values does not yield a correlation, but all the data points can be observed to see wind speeds lower than 15mph

an interesting geographical conclusion I think I did notice, was that cities are much more common on the northern hemisphere vs its counterpart. Considering the enourmouse sample of 1500 cities pulled from the globe, the difference between hemispheres would be close to 50/50 one would assume, but according to the data, the Northern hemisphere does indeed contain a larger amount of cities
